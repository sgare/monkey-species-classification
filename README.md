## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for monkey species classification:
- Preprocessing and augmentation of image data
- Building and training a CNN model
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Saving and exporting the trained model for inference

The model can classify multiple monkey species and is suitable for wildlife research, educational purposes, and machine learning practice.
